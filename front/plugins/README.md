# âš  Disclaimer

Highly experimental feature. Follow the below very carefully and check example plugin(s). Plugin UI is not my priority right now, happy to approve PRs if you are interested in extending/improvintg the UI experience. 

## Overview

PiAlert comes with a simple plugin system to feed events from third-party scripts into the UI and then send notifications if desired.

If you wish to develop a plugin, please check the existing plugin structure. Once the settings are saved by the user they need to be removed from the `pialert.conf` file manually if you want to re-initialize them from the `config.json` of teh plugin.

## Plugin file structure overview 

> Folder name must be the same as the code name value in: `"code_name": "<value>"`
> Unique prefix needs to be unique compared to the other settings prefixes, e.g.: the prefix `APPRISE` is already in use. 

  | File | Required | Description | 
  |----------------------|----------------------|----------------------| 
  | `config.json` | yes | Contains the plugin configuration (manifest) including the settings available to the user. |
  | `script.py` |  yes | The Python script itself |
  | `last_result.log` | yes | The file used to interface between PiAlert and the plugin (script).  |
  | `script.log` | no | Logging output (recommended) |
  | `README.md` | no | Any setup considerations or overview (recommended) |


More on specific files below.

### script.log

Used to interface between PiAlert and the plugin (script). After every scan it should contain only the results from the latest scan/execution. 

- The format is a `csv`-like file with the pipe `|` separator. 8 (eight) values need to be supplied, so every line needs to contain 7 pipe separators. Empty values are represented by `null`  
- Don't render "headers" for these "columns"
- Every scan result / event entry needs to be on a new line
- You can find which "columns" need to be present in the script results and if the value is required below. 
- The order of these "columns" can't be changed


  | Order | Represented Column | Required | Description | 
  |----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------| 
  | 0 | `Object_PrimaryID` | yes | The primary ID used to group Events under. |
  | 1 | `Object_SecondaryID` | no | Optionalsecondary ID to create a relationship beween other entities, such as a MAC address |
  | 2 | `DateTime` | yes | When the event occured in the format `2023-01-02 15:56:30` |
  | 3 | `Watched_Value1` | yes | A value that is watched and users can receive notifications if it changed compared to the previously saved entry. For example IP address |
  | 4 | `Watched_Value2` | no | As above |
  | 5 | `Watched_Value3` | no | As above  |
  | 6 | `Watched_Value4` | no | As above  |
  | 7 | `Extra` | no | Any other data you want to pass and display in PiAlert and the notifcations |

### config.json 

#### params

- `"name":"name_value"` - is used as a wildcard replacement in the `CMD` setting value by using curly brackets `{name_value}`. The wildcard is replaced by the result of the `"value" : "param_value"` and `"type":"type_value"` combo configuration below.
- `"type":"<sql|setting>"` - is used to specify the type of the params, currently only 2 supported (`sql`,`setting`).
  - `"type":"sql"` - will execute the SQL query specified in the `value` property. The sql query needs to return only one column. The column is flattened and separated by commas (`,`), e.g: `SELECT dev_MAC from DEVICES` -> `Internet,74:ac:74:ac:74:ac,44:44:74:ac:74:ac`. This is then used to replace the wildcards in the `CMD`setting.  
  - `"type":"setting"` - The setting code name. A combination of the value from `unique_prefix` + `_` + `function` value, or otherwise the code name you can find in the Settings page under the Setting dispaly name, e.g. `SCAN_CYCLE_MINUTES`. 
- `"value" : "param_value"` - Needs to contain a setting code name or sql query without wildcards.


Example:

```json
{
    "params" : [{
            "name"  : "macs",
            "type"  : "sql",
            "value" : "SELECT dev_MAC from DEVICES"
        },
        {
            "name"  : "urls",
            "type"  : "setting",
            "value" : "WEBMON_urls_to_check"
        },
        {
            "name"  : "internet_ip",
            "type"  : "setting",
            "value" : "WEBMON_SQL_internet_ip"
        }]
}
```


#### Setting object struncture

- `"function": "<see Supported settings function values>"` - What function the setting drives or a simple unique code name
- `"type": "<text|integer|boolean|password|readonly|selectinteger|selecttext|multiselect|list>"` - The form control used for the setting displayed in the Settings page and what values are accepted.
- `"localized"` - a list of properties on the current JSON level which need to be localized
- `"name"` and `"description"` - Displayed in the Settings page. An array of localized strings. (see Localized strings below).
    
##### Supported settings `function` values

- `RUN` - (required) Specifies when the service is executed
    - Supported Options: "disabled", "once", "schedule" (if included then a `RUN_SCHD` setting needs to be specified), "always_after_scan", "on_new_device"
- `RUN_SCHD` - (required if you include the  `RUN`) Cron-like scheduling used if the `RUN` setting set to `schedule`
- `CMD` - (required) What command should be executed. 
- `API_SQL` - (optional) Generates a `table_` + code_name  + `.json` file as per [API docs](https://github.com/jokob-sk/Pi.Alert/blob/main/docs/API.md).
- `RUN_TIMEOUT` - (optional) Max execution time of the script. If not specified a default value of 10 seconds is used to prevent hanging.
- `WATCH` - (optional) Which database columns are watched for changes for this particular plugin. If not specified no notifications are sent. 
- `REPORT_ON` - (optional) Send a notification only on these statuses. Supported options are: 
  - `new` means a new unique (unique combination of PrimaryId and SecondaryId) object was discovered. 
  - `watched-changed` - means that selected `Watched_ValueN` columns changed
  - `watched-not-changed` - reports even on events where selected `Watched_ValueN` did not change


Example:

```json
{
    "function": "RUN",            
    "type": "selecttext",            
    "default_value":"disabled",
    "options": ["disabled", "once", "schedule", "always_after_scan", "on_new_device"],
    "localized": ["name", "description"],
    "name" :[{
        "language_code":"en_us",
        "string" : "When to run"
    }],
    "description": [{
        "language_code":"en_us",
        "string" : "Enable a regular scan of your services. If you select <code>schedule</code> the scheduling settings from below are applied. If you select <code>once</code> the scan is run only once on start of the application (container) for the time specified in <a href=\"#WEBMON_RUN_TIMEOUT\"><code>WEBMON_RUN_TIMEOUT</code> setting</a>."
    }]
}
```
##### Localized strings



- `"language_code":"<en_us|es_es|de_de>"`  - code name of the language string. Only these three currently supported. At least the `"language_code":"en_us"` variant has to be defined. 
- `"string"`  - The string to be displayed in the given language.

Example:

```json

    {
        "language_code":"en_us",
        "string" : "When to run"
    }

```
##### database_column_definitions

- Only columns with `"show": true` and also with at least an english translation will be shown in the UI.
- The `options` property is used in conjunction with these types:
  - `threshold` - The `options` array contains objects from lowest `maximum` to highest with corresponding `hexColor` used for the value background color if it's les sthan the specified `maximum`, but more than the previous one in the `options` array
  - `replace` - The `options` array contains objects with an `equals` property, that is compared to the "value" and if the values are the same, the string in `replacement` is displayed in the UI instead of the actual "value"


```json
{
            "column": "Watched_Value1",
            "show": true,
            "type": "threshold",            
            "default_value":"",
            "options": [
                {
                    "maximum": 199,
                    "hexColor": "#792D86"                
                },
                {
                    "maximum": 299,
                    "hexColor": "#5B862D"
                },
                {
                    "maximum": 399,
                    "hexColor": "#7D862D"
                },
                {
                    "maximum": 499,

                    "maximum": 599,
                    "hexColor": "#D33115"
                }
            ],
            "localized": ["name"],
            "name":[{
                "language_code":"en_us",
                "string" : "Status code"
                }]
        },        
        {
            "column": "Status",
            "show": true,
            "type": "replace",            
            "default_value":"",
            "options": [
                {
                    "equals": "watched-not-changed",
                    "replacement": "<i class='fa-solid fa-square-check'></i>"
                },
                {
                    "equals": "watched-changed",
                    "replacement": "<i class='fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation'></i>"
                },
                {
                    "equals": "new",
                    "replacement": "<i class='fa-solid fa-circle-plus'></i>"
                }
            ],
            "localized": ["name"],
            "name":[{
                "language_code":"en_us",
                "string" : "Status"
                }]
        }
